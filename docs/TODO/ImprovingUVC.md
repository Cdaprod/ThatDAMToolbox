# regarding local files + SMB/NFS + S3 
We have a video-api backend that does this 

# regarding camera capture from any device 
We want to have our own straight forward way of method self hosted runner scripts (same way GitHub actions self-hosted runners are done but on a somewhat different contract) 

# regarding how users interface
We have docker/web-app and web-site and about this we know that:

In enterprise PaaS (Platform as a Service), whether a website and web application share a user database depends on the specific architecture and design decisions made by the organization. There isn’t a universal standard, but here are the common approaches:

**Shared Database Approach:**

- Many enterprises do use a shared user database for their website and web applications to provide a unified user experience
- This enables single sign-on (SSO) across different properties
- Users can log in once and access multiple services seamlessly
- Reduces data duplication and maintenance overhead
- Provides consistent user profiles and preferences across platforms

**Separate Database Approach:**

- Some organizations maintain separate user databases for security, compliance, or architectural reasons
- Different applications may have different user data requirements
- Regulatory requirements might necessitate data isolation
- Legacy systems integration challenges may require separation

**Hybrid Approaches:**

- Identity federation using protocols like SAML, OAuth, or OpenID Connect
- Central identity provider (IdP) manages authentication while applications maintain their own user-specific data
- Microservices architecture where user identity is centralized but application data is distributed

**Key Considerations:**

- **Security**: Shared databases can be single points of failure but may be easier to secure consistently
- **Scalability**: Separate databases can scale independently based on application needs
- **Compliance**: Data residency and privacy regulations may influence database architecture
- **User Experience**: Shared databases typically provide better user experience through unified accounts

The trend in modern enterprise PaaS is toward centralized identity management with distributed application data, often implemented through identity and access management (IAM) solutions.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​

Suggested response from gpt5(lacks full context)

Love this direction. Before I unload a wall of options--what’s your immediate goal for v1: local studio ingest only, or do you also want to pull from URLs/cloud right away?

Here’s a compact map of "things you can funnel in," grouped so you can pick your MVP set:

Local capture (device-level)
	•	UVC/UAC: USB webcams, capture cards (HDMI/SDI), USB microphones
	•	Pro I/O: SDI/HDMI cards (DeckLink/AJA), LTC timecode in
	•	Screens: full display, window, region; virtual displays
	•	External apps: NDI® receive, Syphon/Spout (mac/win), virtual camera

Files without duplication (reference-only)
	•	Local files/folders: MOV/MP4/MKV/MXF/AVI, image sequences (DPX/EXR/PNG/JPG), RAWs (BRAW/R3D/CinemaDNG)
	•	Network mounts: SMB/NFS/WebDAV
	•	Object stores: S3/MinIO buckets (signed URLs, range-reads)
	•	Sidecars: SRT/VTT captions, XML/JSON metadata, EDL/AAF/OTIO timelines (reference edits rather than copy media)

Live/network streams
	•	Pull: RTMP, RTSP, SRT, RIST, HLS (m3u8), MPEG-DASH
	•	Peer/low-latency: WebRTC recv (SFU/WHIP/WHEP), NDI® receive
	•	IP cameras: ONVIF discovery + RTSP/SRT profiles

Web/app sources
	•	Progressive video URLs (direct .mp4/.mov)
	•	HLS/DASH from CDNs
	•	Site extractors (yt-dlp-style) with reference mode (don’t download; capture stream URL + license token)
	•	Browser tab capture via headless browser or WebRTC share (for sites that require JS auth)

Remote & collaborative
	•	Remote agent screens/cameras (your daemon installed on other machines; P2P or relay)
	•	Cloud drives: Google Drive/Dropbox/OneDrive as references (file IDs → signed URLs on demand)

Audio & sync (often overlooked, but vital)
	•	Audio-only inputs: ASIO/CoreAudio/WASAPI, Dante/NDI Audio, RTMP/SRT audio
	•	Timecode/GPS/telemetry feeds: LTC/MTC, MIDI/OSC, camera metadata over IP/USB

Formats/containers you should "understand"
	•	Lossy: H.264/AVC, H.265/HEVC, AV1, VP9
	•	Mezzanine: ProRes, DNxHR, XAVC-Intra
	•	RAW: BRAW, R3D, ARRIRAW, CinemaDNG (even if you proxy-only)
	•	Containers: MOV, MP4, MXF, MKV; playlists: M3U, PLS

How to avoid duplication but still "work at max quality"
	•	Reference-first ingest: store a MediaRef (URI + byte-range capability + integrity hash). No copying by default.
	•	CAS + dedup: content-addressable IDs (SHA-256 of chunks). If a file is added twice (local or cloud), it dedups automatically.
	•	Copy-on-write links: prefer hardlinks/reflinks (btrfs/ZFS/APFS) when you must "move" media inside the repo.
	•	On-demand proxies: generate viewing/edit proxies only when needed and cache them; originals stream direct.
	•	Zero-copy readers: GPU-accelerated decode paths (NVDEC/VideoToolbox/VAAPI) that pull via range-requests from source.
	•	Protocol adapters as plugins: each source implements open(), probe(), read(range), seek(), get_manifest() so your capture daemon treats all inputs uniformly.
	•	Rights/expiry: keep auth tokens in the ref, refresh on access; if a link dies, your daemon knows to re-auth.

⸻

Minimal MVP I’d recommend
	1.	Local files + SMB/NFS + S3 (reference-only)
	2.	RTSP/SRT pull + HLS/DASH URLs
	3.	Screen/window capture + UVC capture
	4.	On-demand proxy pipeline (no upfront copies)

One step to check your understanding: if we only allow reference-first ingest plus on-demand proxies, does that satisfy your "no duplication, stream at max quality" requirement--or do you still have cases where you must make a full local copy (e.g., offline/airgapped editing)?

These screenshots are from https://youtu.be/DfDKT94vjlI?si=lPZdsdD8knAJ8Gr0

And I don’t want to copy them but I’m inspired by their ingenuity and dedication. I myself have a better understanding and methods by which I do this which makes it much better. What’s that?

Awesome refs. Those slides show a classic USB2 UVC pipeline on an FPGA: sensor or pattern generator → UVC handler (frames into UVC payloads) → USB 2.0 device ctrl → PHY → shows up to the host as a UVC camera (your screenshots: YUY2 test pattern at ~20/78 fps). Nice inspiration for how devices present as standard sources.

Here’s how I’d phrase your "what’s better"--the core differentiator vs. OBS-style apps:

Your angle, sharpened
	1.	Reference-first ingest
Never copy media. Store a MediaRef (URI + byte-range + auth + hash). Originals live in SMB/NFS/S3/HTTP/RTSP/etc.; you stream at max quality on demand.
	2.	Universal Source Adapter (USA) layer
Every source--files, URLs, UVC/NDI/WebRTC, RTSP/SRT, headless-browser tab, cloud drives--implements a tiny contract:
open() → capabilities, probe(), read(range|packets), seek(), get_manifest(), close().
The capture daemon treats all inputs uniformly (like your FPGA’s UVC handler, but for protocols).
	3.	Self-hosted runner agents
Lightweight "ingest workers" you drop on any box (Pi, laptop, server). They register to your control plane (Tailscale-friendly), expose local devices/screens, and forward references (or live packets) back. Think GitHub self-hosted runners, but for media IO.
	4.	Zero-copy decode + on-demand proxies
GPU decode (NVDEC/VAAPI/VideoToolbox) from ranged reads; generate proxies only when asked; cache with CAS (chunk hashes) for automatic dedup + hardlink/reflink when a file must appear in a project.
	5.	Identity centralized, data distributed
SSO/IdP for the web site + web app; app keeps per-asset/project metadata while media stays where it is. (Your PaaS note → centralized auth, distributed data.)

V1 source matrix (no duplication)
	•	Local/Network/Object: File paths, SMB/NFS, S3/MinIO (signed URLs, range reads)
	•	Live IP: RTSP/SRT pull, HLS/DASH, WebRTC (WHIP/WHEP), NDI receive
	•	Devices: UVC cameras/capture cards, screen/window capture
	•	Web pages: Headless-browser tab capture for JS-gated sites
	•	Sidecars: SRT/VTT captions, OTIO/EDL/AAF as edits over refs

Minimal plugin skeleton (pseudo)

interface SourceAdapter {
  open(uri: string, opts?: OpenOpts): Promise<Capabilities>;
  probe(): Promise<MediaInfo>;              // streams, codecs, timebase
  read(req: ByteRange|PacketPull): AsyncIterable<Chunk|Packet>;
  seek(timecode: number): Promise<void>;
  getManifest(): Promise<Manifest>;         // playlists, variants
  close(): Promise<void>;
}

Runner contract (self-hosted)
	•	Register: POST /runners {id, caps, nets, devices}
	•	Offer: /sources → list of adapters available locally (UVC, screen, files)
	•	Session: control plane issues a "capture session" with desired tracks → runner returns live packets or resolvable MediaRefs.

Quick check (one question):
If we lock v1 to reference-first ingest + USA adapters + runners (no mandatory copies), does that fully cover your "max quality, no duplication" goal, or do you have a case that still needs full localizing (e.g., offline edits or fragile URLs)?
