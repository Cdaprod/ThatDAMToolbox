Ok let’s say that this app started out as only a python dockerized FastAPI services video-api backend

Primarily being a Media Indexer that bootstraps and lays out the configurable environment(s)--It then went on to having all sorts of awesome modules and core components. Like AI Hierarchal Embedding Layering… Abstract and Concrete Artifacts for abstract filetypes, batches, and process factories… and all kinds of stuff. 

The Python app was responsible for bootstrapping a particular environment; does this process need to be aligned with in the go hosts services apps or if Python isn’t the way do we refactor the bootstrapping of the environment in our application(s) architecture?

Totally fair question. Short answer: stop making video-api the global bootstrapper.
Keep its own migrations/setup, but move cluster & environment bootstrapping into the control-plane (discovery + supervisor) so every node follows the same declarative plan.

Think "control-plane oriented":
	•	Supervisor: owns desired state for the environment (profiles, versions, storage topology, schemas to apply).
	•	Discovery: reconciles node role and applies the parts relevant to that node.
	•	Services (incl. video-api): do self-scoped bootstrap only (DB migrations, module init) when they start--never global cluster setup.

This keeps Python where it shines (media logic, embeddings, pipelines) and puts cross-cutting bootstrap in the Go host layer that already coordinates nodes.

⸻

What to change (concise plan)

1) Define a declarative "environment profile"

Supervisor publishes a profile; discovery/agents reconcile it. Don’t script it inside video-api.

/docs/TECHNICAL/bootstrap-profile-example.yaml

apiVersion: thatdam/v1
kind: EnvironmentProfile
metadata:
  name: default
spec:
  storage:
    buckets:
      - name: media-raw
        lifecycle: {days: 30}
      - name: media-derivatives
      - name: embeddings
  broker:
    vhost: "/"
    exchanges:
      - name: overlay
        type: topic
  indices:
    weaviate:
      classes:
        - name: MediaAsset
          vectorizer: none
          properties: [title, tags, sha256]
        - name: Segment
          vectorizer: none
  services:
    video-api:
      modules:
        - name: embeddings.hierarchical
          params: {levels: ["asset","segment","scene"]}
        - name: artifacts.abstract
      migrations: ["001_init", "002_segments"]

Principle: This is desired state, not imperative scripts.

2) Add control-plane endpoints for bootstrap

Supervisor exposes the profile and status; discovery/agents apply what’s relevant (MinIO buckets, RMQ exchanges, Weaviate schema, etc.).

/host/services/supervisor/cmd/supervisor/routes_bootstrap.go

// Stubs: discovery pulls profile; supervisor tracks status.
// (Codex will fill internals; keep contract stable)

3) Move global bootstrap actions out of video-api

video-api limits itself to:
	•	DB/schema migrations for its own datastore
	•	Module registry initialization
	•	Emitting readiness/feature events

It does not create buckets, exchanges, or cluster-wide schemas.

4) Discovery becomes the applier on each node
	•	Reads the environment profile from supervisor
	•	Applies only node-appropriate pieces:
	•	If node has MinIO creds → ensure buckets.
	•	If node runs broker → ensure exchanges/queues.
	•	If node hosts Weaviate → ensure classes.
	•	Then start local services.

5) Keep "solo mode" compatibility

If no supervisor is found:
	•	Discovery writes cluster.json (leader) and uses a built-in minimal profile (same fields as above).
	•	video-api still runs its self-migrations; cluster resources are created locally by discovery with local creds.

6) Air-gapped ready
	•	Profiles and artifacts live on LAN (Supervisor or MinIO).
	•	No internet required; discovery applies from local endpoints.

7) Observability + idempotence
	•	All bootstrap steps are idempotent and report to overlay.bootstrap.{start|ok|error}.
	•	Frontend can show applied status per component.

⸻

What stays in Python vs moves to Go

Concern	Lives where	Why
Module registration & Py migrations	video-api	Service-local, language-specific
Cluster buckets/queues/schema	discovery (apply) + supervisor (profile)	Cross-service desired state
Desired versions of services/modules	supervisor	Control-plane authority
Node role & service start order	discovery	Node-local reconcile
Embedding pipelines, artifact graph	video-api	Domain logic (Python)


⸻

Tiny contracts you can hand Codex (no internals)

Supervisor API (read side)

/docs/TECHNICAL/bootstrap-api.md

GET  /v1/bootstrap/profile          -> EnvironmentProfile
GET  /v1/bootstrap/status?node_id=… -> {applied:{component:version}, errors:[…]}
POST /v1/bootstrap/events           -> {node_id, component, action, status, message?}  // emitted by agents

Discovery apply steps (checklist)

/docs/TECHNICAL/bootstrap-apply-checklist.md

1) Fetch EnvironmentProfile
2) If storage.buckets: ensure present (create if missing; idempotent)
3) If broker.exchanges: ensure exchanges/queues/bindings
4) If indices.weaviate: upsert classes/properties (no destructive ops)
5) Start local services in plan order; wait for /health
6) Notify supervisor via /v1/bootstrap/events


⸻

Why this refactor is worth it
	•	Single source of truth for env state (Supervisor), not scattered init code.
	•	Idempotent, observable bootstrap; same compose everywhere.
	•	Polyglot friendly: Go orchestrates, Python specializes.
	•	Future-proof for QUIC/HTTP3 or air-gapped bundles.

If you want me to, I’ll generate minimal file stubs (empty handlers + docs with your /path/filename headers) so you can paste a patch and let Codex fill implementations in your house style.




I understand--you want a core implementation that works independently of any external storage, indexing, or messaging services, with those integrations being optional add‑ons. I’ll sketch out how to design a default logic layer that functions even without minio, weaviate, or the broker, and how to bolt those services on seamlessly when they’re available. Let me put together an approach and update you with recommendations on structuring such an abstraction.


The goal you describe--having a "core" that works even when MinIO, Weaviate or a broker aren’t available--fits neatly into the **ports‑and‑adapters** (hexagonal) architecture.  In this pattern your business logic lives in an "inside" layer, while databases, storage, queues and other integrations live in an "outside" layer.  The only way data crosses between the two is through **ports**, which are interfaces defined by the core.  External services are provided via **adapters** that implement those interfaces.  Because the core never directly references an adapter, you can start with in‑memory or file‑based implementations and later "bolt on" adapters for MinIO, Weaviate and RabbitMQ without touching the core.

### Designing the Core APIs

1. **Define ports for each capability** – e.g.:

   ```go
   // storage.go – defines how the core interacts with blob storage
   type ObjectStorage interface {
       EnsureBucket(ctx context.Context, name string) error
       PutObject(ctx context.Context, bucket, key string, r io.Reader) error
       GetObject(ctx context.Context, bucket, key string) (io.ReadCloser, error)
       // …additional methods as needed
   }

   // event.go – defines the event bus contract
   type EventBus interface {
       Publish(ctx context.Context, topic string, payload []byte) error
       Subscribe(ctx context.Context, topic string, handler func([]byte)) error
   }

   // vector.go – defines vector‑search/indexing operations
   type VectorIndex interface {
       Upsert(ctx context.Context, id string, vector []float32, metadata map[string]interface{}) error
       Query(ctx context.Context, vector []float32, k int) ([]SearchResult, error)
   }
   ```

   These interfaces are part of your domain layer.  Business code--such as the supervisor that handles "fetch profile → ensure storage/broker/index → start services"--only imports and depends on these interfaces, not on any concrete implementation.

2. **Provide default adapters** – implement the ports using simple, always‑available mechanisms.  For example:

   * **File‑system storage**: implement `ObjectStorage` with OS file operations; use a directory per "bucket".
   * **Local event bus**: implement `EventBus` using Go channels or an in‑process pub/sub; messages stay inside one process.
   * **In‑memory vector index**: implement `VectorIndex` using a simple map and a linear search (adequate for small datasets).

   These adapters satisfy the ports but have no external dependencies, so your core runs on a single machine without MinIO, Weaviate or RabbitMQ.

3. **Optional service adapters** – add adapters that wrap MinIO, Weaviate and RabbitMQ.  Each implements the same port interfaces but delegates to the corresponding service:

   * A `MinioStorage` adapter can use the `BucketExists` and `MakeBucket` logic described earlier to satisfy `EnsureBucket` and use `PutObject`/`GetObject` for object operations.
   * A `RabbitMQBus` adapter can use `ExchangeDeclare`, `QueueDeclare` and `Publish` operations; declarations are idempotent so repeated calls are safe.
   * A `WeaviateIndex` adapter can use the schema existence checks and property creation methods; call `client.Schema().ClassExistenceChecker().Do()` to see if a class exists and create it only if needed.

4. **Runtime configuration** – build a small factory that inspects environment variables or a configuration file and instantiates the right adapter for each port.  For example:

   ```go
   func NewObjectStorageFromConfig(cfg Config) ObjectStorage {
       if cfg.MinioEndpoint != "" {
           return NewMinioStorage(cfg.MinioEndpoint, cfg.AccessKey, cfg.SecretKey)
       }
       return NewFileSystemStorage(cfg.StorageDir)
   }
   ```

   The factory selects the MinIO adapter when connection details are present; otherwise it falls back to the file‑system implementation.  The same approach can be applied to the event bus and vector index.

5. **Migration / fall‑forward logic** – if you want to "fall forward" when a service becomes available at runtime, implement a proxy adapter that starts with the default implementation and automatically switches to, or replicates into, the external service when it becomes reachable.  For instance, an `AutoStorage` wrapper could write to local disk until MinIO responds, then copy existing objects to MinIO and switch its internal delegate.

### Benefits

* **Isolation of core logic:** The hexagonal architecture explicitly isolates your business logic from external tools.  As long as the ports don’t change, you can add or remove adapters without rewriting the core.
* **Testability:** Default adapters let you run unit tests without any external dependencies.  You can also plug in mocks that implement the same interfaces.
* **Incremental adoption:** You can ship a self‑contained version of your application today and later add MinIO, Weaviate or RabbitMQ by simply adding new adapter packages and updating configuration.
* **Graceful degradation:** When a service is unavailable, the core continues to function using the default adapters.  When the service becomes available, the factory switches to the more capable adapter.

By defining clear interfaces (ports) for storage, events and indexing, and by supplying both simple in‑process implementations and full‑fledged adapters for MinIO, RabbitMQ and Weaviate, your application can run in a minimal configuration yet "fall forward" to richer capabilities whenever those services are connected.




You’re thinking exactly in the right direction: make the core reconcile layer idempotent and let "real" services (MinIO, RabbitMQ, Weaviate) be optional adapters. Below is a tight, copy-paste-able spec you can drop into the repo that captures the patterns proven in production OSS--without locking you to any one SDK. It’s abstract where it should be, concrete where idempotency needs rules.

⸻

Environment Bootstrap (Idempotent Reconcile Spec)

Prime rule

Every apply step is safe to run repeatedly and order-independent. Treat desired config as truth; compute a diff; apply only missing pieces; never destructive by default.

⸻

0) Ports & reconcilers (hexagonal baseline)

Contracts (ports) the core depends on
	•	ObjectStorage: ensure bucket, set lifecycle/tags, put/get object.
	•	EventBus: ensure exchange/queue/binding, publish with idempotency key.
	•	VectorIndex: ensure class, add missing properties, upsert vectors.

Provide default adapters (FS storage, in-proc bus, in-mem index) so the system works with no external services. Swap to MinIO/RabbitMQ/Weaviate when available.

⸻

1) Storage (MinIO-compatible) -- idempotent apply recipe

Desired: list of buckets with lifecycle rules and tags.

Idempotent steps (per bucket):
	1.	Exists? If not, Create (MakeBucket). If exists, continue.
	2.	Versioning: If required=on and current=off → Enable. If on already → no-op.
	3.	Lifecycle: Fetch current rules; merge-add any missing rules by ID; never delete on default path.
	4.	Tags: Fetch tags; add/overwrite only the keys you manage; don’t remove unknown tags.
	5.	Policy (optional): If you manage policy, set named policy only if absent or checksum differs.

Failure patterns to treat as no-op: "already exists", "not modified", "unknown tag key present".

Backoff & retries: exponential backoff with jitter; fail closed after N attempts; emit overlay.bootstrap.storage.{ok|error}.

⸻

2) Broker (RabbitMQ-compatible) -- idempotent apply recipe

Desired: exchanges, queues, and bindings per vhost.

Idempotent steps (per vhost):
	1.	ExchangeDeclare (durable=true, passive=false) – safe to repeat.
	2.	QueueDeclare (durable=true, passive=false) – safe to repeat.
	3.	QueueBind (queue, exchange, routing key) – safe to repeat.
	4.	Publisher confirms enabled for publish path (observability).
	5.	DLX / TTL (optional): declare dead-letter and policy by name; only add/update named policies you manage.

Never do by default: delete exchanges/queues/bindings; rename; purge.

Backoff & retries: reconnect with backoff; idempotency key on publish; emit overlay.bootstrap.broker.{ok|error}.

⸻

3) Vector index (Weaviate-compatible) -- idempotent apply recipe

Desired: classes with properties (non-destructive evolution).

Idempotent steps:
	1.	Class exists? If not, CreateClass.
	2.	Properties: For each desired property:
	•	If absent → AddProperty.
	•	If present but differs in type or indexing → log + skip (non-destructive path); emit a "needs migration" event.
	3.	Tenants (optional): Add any missing tenants; do not delete.

Never do by default: drop classes or properties; change property types.

Backoff & retries: standard; emit overlay.bootstrap.index.{ok|error}.

⸻

4) Reconcilers (execution order & safety)

Global order: storage → broker → index → start services.

Per reconciler:
	•	Read desired → Read actual → Diff → Apply adds/updates only.
	•	Record an apply generation hash; skip work if unchanged.
	•	Emit events to overlay.bootstrap.* with {component, action, status, message?, generation}.

Offline/air-gapped: fall back to default adapters (FS / in-proc / in-mem). When external service becomes reachable, reconcilers "fall forward" and sync.

⸻

5) Config detection & adapters (no hard deps)
	•	If MINIO_ENDPOINT present → use MinIO adapter; else FS adapter.
	•	If AMQP_URL present → use RabbitMQ adapter; else in-proc bus.
	•	If WEAVIATE_URL present → use Weaviate adapter; else in-mem index.
	•	Discovery picks adapters at boot; Supervisor provides desired spec; both remain operational without externals.

⸻

6) Observability & idempotency keys
	•	Include idempotency_key = sha256(node_id + component + generation + desired_hash) on any mutation/publish.
	•	Structured logs via logx with fields: component, action, attempt, idempotent, generation, duration_ms.
	•	Health surface: /internal/bootstrap/status reflects last apply per component.

⸻

7) Safety rails (non-destructive by design)
	•	Default reconcilers never delete or change types.
	•	"Destructive" mode is opt-in and guarded by a Supervisor intent (e.g., allow_destructive=true) and dry-run diff must be acknowledged.

⸻

8) Test matrix (quick)
	•	Cold start, no externals → FS/in-proc/in-mem only → all no-ops after first run.
	•	Cold start, with externals → create once → second run no-ops.
	•	Loss & recreate (delete a queue manually) → reapply adds it back.
	•	Schema evolution (add property) → property added; incompatible change emits "needs migration".

⸻

File layout (suggested; adapters optional now)

/docs/TECHNICAL/bootstrap-reconcile.md -- (paste this spec)

/host/services/supervisor/internal/ports/
	•	storage.go -- ObjectStorage (EnsureBucket, Put, Get, SetLifecycle, SetTags)
	•	bus.go -- EventBus (EnsureExchange, EnsureQueue, EnsureBinding, Publish)

/host/services/supervisor/internal/reconcile/
	•	storage_reconciler.go
	•	broker_reconciler.go

Minimal contracts (no implementations; safe for Codex)

type PropertySpec struct {
	Name string
	Type string // text, number, boolean, vectorRef, ...
}

type VectorIndex interface {
	EnsureClass(ctx context.Context, c ClassSpec) error
	EnsureProperties(ctx context.Context, class string, props []PropertySpec) error
	UpsertVector(ctx context.Context, class, id string, vector []float32, meta map[string]any) error
}


⸻

Discovery apply order (one-screen checklist)
	1.	Read desired env from Supervisor.
	2.	Storage: ensure buckets → versioning → lifecycle → tags.
	3.	Broker: ensure exchange → queue → binding; enable confirms.
	4.	Index: ensure class → add missing properties.
	5.	Start/verify services; emit overlay.bootstrap.*.
	6.	Sleep; repeat -- idempotent.

⸻

Why this mirrors "how big OSS does it"
	•	S3/MinIO: bucket create, then non-destructive lifecycle/tag merges.
	•	RabbitMQ: declare ops are idempotent; re-declaring is the norm.
	•	Weaviate: schema changes are additive; destructive changes are migrations, not "apply".

If you want, I can follow up with tiny in-proc default adapters (FS, channels, in-mem) so you can run this reconcile loop with zero external services on a dev laptop -- and flip to MinIO/RabbitMQ/Weaviate by just setting env vars.


I need to combine that with the architecture bootstrapping
