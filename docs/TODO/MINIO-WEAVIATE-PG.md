Totally--there’s a cleaner, more future-proof way than picking one global username.

The "better way" in a nutshell

Use per-service, least-privilege identities issued just-in-time by an IdP/issuer, not one static app user. Concretely:
	1.	Identity model
	•	Humans: thatdam-admin (ops), thatdam-operator (support).
	•	Machines (per service + env):
svc.video-api.dev, svc.capture-daemon.edge1, svc.camera-proxy.edge2, svc.media-importer.dev, etc.
	•	Optional tenant: svc.video-api.dev@acme if you go multi-tenant.
	2.	AuthN/AuthZ primitives
	•	OIDC/JWT everywhere possible; fall back to static creds only for dev.
	•	Short-lived creds via STS/dynamic issuance:
	•	MinIO: STS with OIDC (AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity) → temporary S3 keys bound to policy.
	•	Postgres: dynamic DB users (HashiCorp Vault DB engine) mapped to roles.
	•	Weaviate: enable OIDC (or API keys now, OIDC later) with role claims → class/operation RBAC.
	3.	RBAC by service (not by "the app")
	•	Example buckets/DB/schema permissions:
	•	svc.capture-daemon.* → s3:PutObject to thatdam/ingest/*, no delete.
	•	svc.video-api.* → read from thatdam/*, write only to thatdam/previews/*.
	•	svc.media-importer.* → list + put in thatdam/import/*, no access to ingest/.
	•	Postgres: schema owner role (admin only), runtime roles (service-scoped) with only SELECT/INSERT on specific tables.
	•	Weaviate: video-api can CRUD VideoAsset; capture-daemon can create CaptureEvent but not delete assets.
	4.	Naming that scales
	•	svc.<service>.<env>[.<site>] (machine) and human.<role> (people).
Examples: svc.video-api.prod, svc.capture-daemon.rpi5-2, human.thatdam-admin.
	5.	Secret management + rotation
	•	Dev: docker-compose .env with static test secrets.
	•	Stage/Prod: Vault (or SSM/Secrets Manager) issues:
	•	MinIO STS credentials (15–60 min TTL).
	•	Postgres users (4–24 hr TTL).
	•	JWTs for Weaviate via your IdP (Keycloak/Auth0/Okta).

Practical migration plan (no boil-the-ocean)

Phase 0 (now, compose/dev)

Keep it simple but prepare the shape:
	•	Create multiple static users instead of one:
	•	svc.capture-daemon.dev
	•	svc.video-api.dev
	•	human.thatdam-admin
	•	MinIO: per-service access keys with minimal policies.
	•	Postgres: split schema owner (thatdamadmin) from runtime (svc.video_api_dev, svc_capture_daemon_dev).
	•	Weaviate: enable API key auth with per-service keys (or OIDC later).

Phase 1 (soon)
	•	Stand up Keycloak (or your IdP).
	•	Switch MinIO to OIDC/STS; map sub/aud to MinIO policies.
	•	Switch Weaviate to OIDC; map JWT roles to Weaviate RBAC.
	•	Put static Postgres passwords behind Vault while you wire up dynamic creds.

Phase 2 (later)
	•	Postgres → Vault dynamic users only; retire static DB passwords.
	•	Rotate MinIO to STS only; no long-lived S3 keys in services.
	•	Enforce mTLS east-west (optional but nice).

Concrete snippets to get you started

1) MinIO (dev) – per-service users + policies

Create two service accounts and least-privilege policies:

Policy: capture-daemon can only PUT to ingest/

{
  "Version":"2012-10-17",
  "Statement":[
    {"Effect":"Allow","Action":["s3:PutObject"],"Resource":["arn:aws:s3:::thatdam/ingest/*"]},
    {"Effect":"Allow","Action":["s3:ListBucket"],"Resource":["arn:aws:s3:::thatdam"],"Condition":{"StringLike":{"s3:prefix":["ingest/*"]}}}
  ]
}

Policy: video-api can GET from all, PUT to previews/

{
  "Version":"2012-10-17",
  "Statement":[
    {"Effect":"Allow","Action":["s3:GetObject"],"Resource":["arn:aws:s3:::thatdam/*"]},
    {"Effect":"Allow","Action":["s3:PutObject"],"Resource":["arn:aws:s3:::thatdam/previews/*"]},
    {"Effect":"Allow","Action":["s3:ListBucket"],"Resource":["arn:aws:s3:::thatdam"]}
  ]
}

Apply with mc:

mc alias set minio http://localhost:9000 minio minio123
mc admin user add minio svc.capture-daemon.dev <secret1>
mc admin user add minio svc.video-api.dev     <secret2>

mc admin policy create minio policy-capture-daemon capture-daemon.json
mc admin policy create minio policy-video-api     video-api.json

mc admin policy attach minio policy-capture-daemon --user svc.capture-daemon.dev
mc admin policy attach minio policy-video-api     --user svc.video-api.dev

mc mb -p minio/thatdam

(When you move to OIDC/STSs, these policies stay; the principals become JWT-assumed roles instead of static users.)

2) Postgres – split ownership from runtime

-- One-time: schema owner (admin use only)
CREATE ROLE thatdamadmin WITH LOGIN PASSWORD '...';

-- Runtime roles (per service)
CREATE ROLE svc_video_api_dev       WITH LOGIN PASSWORD '...';
CREATE ROLE svc_capture_daemon_dev  WITH LOGIN PASSWORD '...';

-- App schema owned by admin; runtime roles get limited rights
CREATE SCHEMA IF NOT EXISTS dam AUTHORIZATION thatdamadmin;

GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA dam TO svc_video_api_dev, svc_capture_daemon_dev;
GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA dam TO svc_video_api_dev;
GRANT SELECT, INSERT          ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA dam TO svc_capture_daemon_dev;
ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES IN SCHEMA dam GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE ON TABLES TO svc_video_api_dev;
ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES IN SCHEMA dam GRANT SELECT, INSERT          ON TABLES TO svc_capture_daemon_dev;

3) Weaviate – API keys now, OIDC later

Dev compose:

environment:
  AUTHENTICATION_APIKEY_ENABLED: "true"
  AUTHENTICATION_APIKEY_ALLOWED_KEYS: "key-video-api-dev,key-capture-daemon-dev"
  AUTHENTICATION_APIKEY_USERS: "svc.video-api.dev,svc.capture-daemon.dev"

Later, flip to OIDC:

environment:
  AUTHENTICATION_OIDC_ENABLED: "true"
  OIDC_ISSUER: "https://keycloak/realms/thatdam"
  OIDC_CLIENT_ID: "weaviate"
  AUTHORIZATION_ADMINLIST_ENABLED: "true"
  AUTHORIZATION_ADMINLIST_USERS: "human.thatdam-admin"


⸻

Why this beats a single thatdamuser
	•	Blast radius is tiny per service.
	•	Rotation is trivial (rotate one principal).
	•	Observability: logs tell you which service did what.
	•	Future ready: easy hop to STS/OIDC and dynamic DB creds.

If you want, I can produce:
	•	A dev docker-compose overlay that creates the two MinIO users + policies at boot,
	•	A SQL bootstrap file for Postgres roles,
	•	A Weaviate env for API-key auth today with a commented OIDC block to switch on later.

This keeps your current compose flow intact but sets you up for the strong model above.
