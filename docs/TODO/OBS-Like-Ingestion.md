To provide an OBS‑like ingest layer for your DAM platform without duplicating media, consider supporting these source families:
Local device capture
USB/UVC webcams and capture cards
SDI/HDMI interfaces (DeckLink/AJA)
Screens or windows (desktop capture)
Audio devices and timecode inputs
Existing files without copying
Local video containers (MP4/MOV/MKV/MXF) and image sequences
Network shares (SMB/NFS/WebDAV) and object stores (S3/MinIO) referenced via signed URLs or range reads
Sidecar data: captions, metadata, edit decision lists
Network and live streams
Pull: RTMP, RTSP, SRT, RIST, HLS/DASH
Low‑latency/peer: WebRTC, NDI® receive
IP cameras (ONVIF discovery)
Web and cloud sources
Direct progressive URLs or playlist formats from CDNs
Browser‑based/tab capture for sites requiring JS auth
Cloud drives or remote agents that expose signed references on demand
Auxiliary data
Audio‑only inputs (microphones, Dante/NDI Audio)
Timecode or telemetry feeds (LTC/MIDI/OSC) for sync
The repository’s architecture already highlights several input categories--IP cameras, local files, upload sources, and backup sources--providing a natural starting point for unifying ingest pipelines. Planned monitoring capabilities such as real‑time data over WebSockets and large‑file streaming further reinforce a flexible, reference‑based workflow that avoids full copies of media assets
