Hereâ€™s how you can build a fully preâ€‘configured Raspberry Pi image--no user interaction required at first boot:

âœ… Method: Use cloudâ€‘init on Raspberry Pi OS or Ubuntu

ðŸ“Œ Why cloud-init?

It allows you to drop in configuration files before first boot to:
	â€¢	create users with SSH keys,
	â€¢	set networking (static or Wiâ€‘Fi),
	â€¢	install packages and run scripts,
	â€¢	completely avoid onâ€‘boot prompts  ï¿¼ ï¿¼ ï¿¼.

ðŸŽ¯ Steps Overview
	1.	Choose a base image:
	â€¢	Raspberry Pi OS Lite + install cloudâ€‘init manually, or
	â€¢	Ubuntu Server for Raspberry Pi (cloudâ€‘init preinstalled)  ï¿¼ ï¿¼.
	2.	Flash the image to SD card or USB via dd or Raspberry Pi Imager.
	3.	Mount the "boot" or "system-boot" FAT partition.
	4.	Drop in cloud-init config files:
	â€¢	user-data: YAML defining users, SSH keys, packages, scripts.
	â€¢	meta-data: at least a hostname identifier.
	â€¢	network-config: optional, for static IP / Wiâ€‘Fi  ï¿¼ ï¿¼.
	5.	Unmount, then insert into your Pi and power on.
	6.	cloud-init runs, applying everything before network/SSH become active. No prompts after  ï¿¼ ï¿¼.

ðŸ’» Example user-data (cloud-config)

#cloud-config
hostname: my-pi-001
users:
  - name: cdauser
    gecos: "Cdaprod DevOps"
    ssh_authorized_keys:
      - ssh-rsa AAAA...
    sudo: ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL
    shell: /bin/bash
    lock_passwd: false
chpasswd:
  list:
    - "cdauser:superSecurePassword"
  expire: false
ssh_pwauth: false
package_update: true
package_upgrade: true
packages:
  - git
  - docker.io
runcmd:
  - [ mkdir, -p, /opt/myapp ]
  - [ git, clone, 'https://github.com/Cdaprod/myapp.git', '/opt/myapp' ]
  - [ bash, -lc, 'cd /opt/myapp && ./setup.sh' ]
final_message: "Setup complete!"

And minimal meta-data:

instance-id: my-pi-001
local-hostname: my-pi-001

Put these in the boot partition, named exactly user-data and meta-data, then unmount.

ðŸ§© Kernel Cmdline Customization

If you want more advanced hooks (like what Raspberry Pi Imager does), check /usr/lib/raspberrypi-sys-mods/imager_custom. They inject a firstrun.sh via cmdline.txt, then remove it on first boot  ï¿¼ ï¿¼ ï¿¼ ï¿¼.

You can mimic/improve that if you need very custom pre-boot behavior.

ðŸ”š Summary
	â€¢	Cloudâ€‘init gives total firstâ€‘boot automation--user creation, networking, packages, scripts.
	â€¢	Drop user-data, meta-data, (network-config) into FAT system-boot before flashing.
	â€¢	Pi boots fully configured--no prompts, headless ready, SSH up with your config.
	â€¢	Useful references: pi-cloud-init project on GitHub  ï¿¼.
