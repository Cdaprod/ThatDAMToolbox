Alright -- here’s a longer, more immersive walkthrough that still follows your narrative style but really paints the picture so someone can feel the experience of using ThatDAM from public website to full web app.

Walkthrough (Narrative First)

⸻

1) Public Website → "Why ThatDAM?"

Goal: Educate, inspire, qualify, and convert to trial.

I land on thatdam.com. The background isn’t static -- it’s alive with a mosaic grid of subtle looping video clips and images, hinting at real creative projects. The tagline is short and direct:

"Browse every asset--local & cloud--in one place. Live ingest from cameras or import from your NAS. Hybrid-cloud DAM built for creators and teams."

Front and center are two primary CTAs:
	•	[Try the Live Explorer] → instantly shows me a demo asset library.
	•	[Request Early Access] → sends me into sign-up.

Below the fold, I’m guided through three hero panels:
	1.	Explore -- an interactive map of folders, NAS, and cloud buckets with zoomable paths and instant previews.
	2.	Ingest -- a simulation of a live feed from a camera-proxy, showing thumbnails updating in real time.
	3.	Automate -- a simple visual of AI tagging, proxy generation, and automated distribution to publishing targets.

Scrolling further, I see a partners/credibility row -- familiar logos from storage, AI, and media companies. Quick looping GIFs show:
	•	Dragging in a NAS drive and seeing it populate the Explorer instantly.
	•	Switching to Live Monitor and seeing multiple cameras in real-time.
	•	Running a one-click AI job that tags and categorizes hundreds of clips.

A compact "How It Fits" diagram gives me the architecture at a glance -- sources → hybrid cloud → tools → distribution.

The footer reinforces the call-to-action: [Create Workspace → Onboarding].

⸻

2) Create Workspace (Light Onboarding)

The onboarding flow is fast and deliberate:
	1.	I’m asked to choose between:
	•	Cloud-only (manage assets in ThatDAM cloud).
	•	Hybrid (connect NAS or local network drives now or later).
	2.	I enter an Organization Name and Workspace Name.
	3.	I sign in (SSO or email/password).

When I finish, the screen fades directly into the Web App with a subtle welcome overlay. A coachmark points to the primary button:

"Connect your first source to start exploring."

⸻

3) Web App → "Dashboard of Tool Cards is Home"

Goal: Instantly show that assets are central. Sources (like live cameras) are just one way to add them.

The Dashboard Home is clean -- rows of large Tool Cards. Each card is a gateway to a major capability:
	•	DAM Explorer -- browse and search assets across all connected sources.
	•	Live Monitor -- view multiple active camera feeds at once.
	•	Capture -- manage ingest and recording from a single camera.
	•	Jobs -- run background tasks like proxy generation, AI tagging, motion extraction.
	•	Admin -- configure users, roles, retention policies, transcoding profiles, and API keys.

Example flow:
	•	I click Connect Source.
	•	Choose Camera Proxy → instantly see a live thumbnail from my remote device. I can Preview, Record, or Route to Collection.
	•	Choose Network Storage → select NAS/SMB/S3; folder tree indexes in seconds; I can Pin any folder as a Collection.

Inside Explorer, I can:
	•	Browse by Collections, Folders, or Tags.
	•	Toggle between Grid View and Timeline View for media.
	•	Select an asset → view previews, metadata, related assets.

From any asset, I can:
	•	Run Jobs → AI tagging, proxy creation, format transcode.
	•	Share → create a read-only link or invite a collaborator with role-based permissions.

Admin view gives me global control:
	•	Define Retention Policies (e.g., keep proxies 30 days, masters forever).
	•	Create Transcode Profiles for automatic deliverables.
	•	Manage User Roles with fine-grained permissions (Explorer-only, Ingest-only, Full Admin).

⸻

This flow communicates ThatDAM as more than just a live capture tool -- it’s a complete hybrid-cloud digital asset platform where ingest is one door among many, but the central hub is asset organization, browsing, and automation.

If you want, I can now follow this up with a companion ultra-simplified diagram for the README so the complexity is in doc/DIAGRAMS.md but visitors get an at-a-glance version right on GitHub. That way you balance marketing clarity with technical depth.

Do you want me to do that next?
