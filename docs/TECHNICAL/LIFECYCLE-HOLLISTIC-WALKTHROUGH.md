Explain what I want for the most absolute beauty of a system‚Ä¶ how do I want to theoretically but factually share resources or what across my distributed system 

Can we add our deployment to that?

Say maybe like‚Ä¶.

Run the same way on 5 machines:

1. raspberry pi 5 (pi os desktop web browser gui desktop), 
2. raspberry pi 5 (Ubuntu for pi server), 
3. windows 11 desktop, 
4. raspberry pi zero w 2,
5. MacBook

Becomes one concurrently running distributed system.

If we deploy in this order we want to be able to reconcile distribution in a non burdening way for all‚Ä¶ if we have 

1. raspberry pi 5 (pi os desktop web browser gui), 

Install first it should build a capture-daemon role which comes with subsequent api and frontend related services

Then if we add another‚Ä¶

2. raspberry pi 5 (Ubuntu for pi server), 

When it installs it should join the ring as a node or would the system as a whole prefer to be a peer to the existing node (1. raspberry pi 5 (pi os web browser gui desktop))?

I‚Äôm trying to decide if that means that capture-daemon is it for when we aggregate video from as existing assets (media files for explorer) and maybe camera-proxy is for when we need to aggregate only the video preview/recording?

So figure this out ‚òùÔ∏è and we‚Äôll move on in the lifecycle walkthrough now üëá

We install to:

3. windows 11 desktop 

Which is an video editing machine with cameras which means we will need to index existing media for our stateless explorer and capture camera feed and use it in our initial "1. raspberry pi 5 (pi os web browser gui desktop)" dfs and reconcile that the "3. windows 11 desktop" has added resources we can utilize towards our distributed system in exchange for allowing our system to serve it (we don‚Äôt want to bog down our systems resources (1. raspberry pi 5 (pi os web browser gui desktop))‚Ä¶ because were processing someone else‚Äôs data (3. windows 11 desktop) when they could have been a node in our ring and made things so much less reliant on resources, if they had of <insert manner of sharing>‚Ä¶

We can definitely abstract to the lowest level necessary to figure out what our deployment plans patterns are going to be ‚òùÔ∏è that will make a lot more sense of everything being the rest of what we are about to do üëá 

We then install on:

4. raspberry pi zero w 2 (alpine or ubuntu or pi os)

Which is has a web cam plugged into it‚Ä¶ for this it becomes a camera proxy which if it has been ran outside of the network would spin up its own embedded proxy-viewer endpoint‚Ä¶ but since it‚Äôs in the network, it provides a capture device for all the cameras it has connected to it as a video that our capture daemon and explorer frontend uses to record and preview with which is naturally not using a embedded proxy-viewer web app) 

Then we install on 

5. MacBook

And it is needed to index new media via our stateless previewable CAS blob store etc‚Ä¶ and route any cameras or video capture streams whether actual camera or something like AirPlay mirroring (regardless we can now access all machines assets and input captured cameras together in our frontend DAM Explorer‚Ä¶. /docker/web-app üëè 

This is all deployed locally‚Ä¶ but if someone didn‚Äôt have it deployed locally they‚Äôd default to our cloud platform

# Distributed Media System Architecture

## Core Resource Sharing Philosophy

Your system should share **computational capacity, storage bandwidth, and processing intelligence** rather than just raw memory. This creates a true distributed computing mesh where each node contributes what it does best.

## Node Role Assignment Strategy

### 1. Raspberry Pi 5 (Pi OS Desktop) - **Orchestrator Node**

- **Primary Role**: `capture-daemon` + `frontend-coordinator`
- **Responsibilities**:
  - DAM Explorer web interface
  - Distributed task coordination
  - CAS blob store coordinator
  - Initial discovery beacon
- **Resource Contribution**: GUI rendering, web serving, coordination logic

### 2. Raspberry Pi 5 (Ubuntu Server) - **Peer Storage Node**

- **Join Pattern**: **Peer-to-peer** (not subordinate)
- **Primary Role**: `storage-engine` + `capture-daemon`
- **Responsibilities**:
  - High-availability CAS storage
  - Backup coordination services
  - Media indexing worker
- **Resource Contribution**: Dedicated storage bandwidth, headless processing power

### 3. Windows 11 Desktop - **Compute Powerhouse Node**

- **Join Pattern**: **Resource Exchange Peer**
- **Primary Role**: `media-processor` + `storage-contributor`
- **Resource Exchange Model**:
  - **Contributes**: Heavy video processing, transcoding, AI analysis
  - **Receives**: Access to distributed media library, camera feeds
  - **Protection**: Rate-limited processing to prevent resource drain on Pi nodes
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Video editing/transcoding tasks
  - AI media analysis
  - Large media file indexing
  - Local media contribution to CAS

### 4. Raspberry Pi Zero W 2 - **Edge Capture Node**

- **Primary Role**: `camera-proxy`
- **Intelligent Networking**:
  - **In-network**: Provides camera streams to capture-daemon cluster
  - **Isolated**: Spins up embedded `proxy-viewer` for standalone operation
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Camera stream aggregation
  - Edge recording buffer
  - Network-aware stream routing

### 5. MacBook - **Intelligence Node**

- **Primary Role**: `index-engine` + `stream-processor`
- **Responsibilities**:
  - AI-powered media analysis
  - AirPlay/screen capture integration
  - Mobile media ingestion
  - Advanced search indexing

## Distributed System Patterns

### Resource Sharing Model

```
Computational Mesh:
- CPU cycles for transcoding (Windows ‚Üí Pi cluster)
- Storage bandwidth (All nodes ‚Üí CAS coordination)
- Network bandwidth (Load balancing across nodes)
- Specialized hardware (Cameras, GPUs, display capability)
```

### Service Discovery & Coordination

```
Ring Topology with Intelligent Routing:
1. Each node announces capabilities on join
2. Coordinator (Pi 5 Desktop) maintains capability map
3. Tasks routed to optimal nodes based on:
   - Resource availability
   - Hardware specialization
   - Network proximity
   - Current load
```

### Deployment Sequence Benefits

1. **Pi 5 Desktop** establishes coordination infrastructure
1. **Pi 5 Server** adds resilience and storage capacity
1. **Windows Desktop** adds compute power without overwhelming coordinators
1. **Pi Zero** extends capture capabilities to network edge
1. **MacBook** adds intelligence and mobile integration

## Resource Protection Mechanisms

### Preventing Resource Drain

- **Task Queuing**: Heavy processing queued during low-usage periods
- **Resource Quotas**: Each node reserves capacity for local operations
- **Priority Scheduling**: Local tasks > distributed tasks > external requests
- **Graceful Degradation**: System continues with reduced capability if nodes drop

### Exchange Fairness

```
Contribution Score System:
- Nodes earn credits by contributing resources
- Credits consumed when using distributed resources
- High-capacity nodes (Windows) can "bank" credits
- Low-capacity nodes (Pi Zero) get baseline allocation
```

## Service Architecture

### capture-daemon vs camera-proxy Distinction

- **capture-daemon**: Aggregates and manages multiple video sources (files + live streams)
- **camera-proxy**: Specialized for live camera stream handling and edge buffering
- **Integration**: camera-proxy feeds into capture-daemon cluster

### Stateless CAS Design

```
Content-Addressed Storage:
- Each media file becomes immutable blob with hash identifier
- Distributed across nodes based on capacity and redundancy needs
- Metadata stored separately for fast searching
- Preview thumbnails cached on GUI nodes
```

## Deployment Lifecycle

### Phase 1: Foundation (Pi 5 Desktop)

```bash
# Establishes:
# - Service discovery
# - Web interface
# - Initial CAS store
# - Coordination APIs
```

### Phase 2: Resilience (Pi 5 Server)

```bash
# Adds:
# - Storage redundancy
# - Background processing capacity
# - High-availability coordination
```

### Phase 3: Power (Windows Desktop)

```bash
# Contributes:
# - Heavy compute capability
# - Local media indexing
# - Professional video tools integration
# Receives distributed media access
```

### Phase 4: Edge Extension (Pi Zero)

```bash
# Extends:
# - Camera capture to network edge
# - Autonomous operation capability
# - Lightweight stream processing
```

### Phase 5: Intelligence (MacBook)

```bash
# Enhances:
# - AI-powered media analysis
# - Mobile device integration
# - Advanced indexing capabilities
```

## Cloud Fallback Strategy

For users without full local deployment:

- **Hybrid Mode**: Some services local, others cloud-hosted
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Start cloud, migrate services local as hardware added
- **Seamless Transition**: Same APIs whether local or cloud backend

We can definitely abstract to the lowest level necessary to figure out what our deployment plans patterns are going to be ‚òùÔ∏è that will make a lot more sense of everything being the rest of what we are about to do üëá 

We then install on:

4. raspberry pi zero w 2 (alpine or ubuntu or pi os)

Which is has a web cam plugged into it‚Ä¶ for this it becomes a camera proxy which if it has been ran outside of the network would spin up its own embedded proxy-viewer endpoint‚Ä¶ but since it‚Äôs in the network, it provides a capture device for all the cameras it has connected to it as a video that our capture daemon and explorer frontend uses to record and preview with which is naturally not using a embedded proxy-viewer web app) 

Then we install on 

5. MacBook

And it is needed to index new media via our stateless previewable CAS blob store etc‚Ä¶ and route any cameras or video capture streams whether actual camera or something like AirPlay mirroring (regardless we can now access all machines assets and input captured cameras together in our frontend DAM Explorer‚Ä¶. /docker/web-app üëè 

That‚Äôs awesome now we just need to figure it out in a way that if we deployed them in a completely different order that they would algorithmically and deterministic in self configuring way do the same thing everytime no matter when installed or spun--in other words, without hardcoding upstream.. we already abstracted our docker (we have all that and executor, maybe we‚Äôll bolt on docker install later). FWIW I picture this being installed like you would a self hosted runner on GitHub with its own user account settings configuration page‚Ä¶ but in our own cloud web-app‚Ä¶ where we have the user reroute to their local self hosted similar looking instead. Where if they have license they can route publicly to be their own "recording house" and we don‚Äôt have to provide any cpu or gpu resources (bring your own resources).)

Absolutely--we can make the deployment order-agnostic and self-configuring so any of the 5 machines can be installed first (or last) and the cluster converges to the same layout every time, with no hardcoded upstream.

Order-agnostic, self-configuring deployment

0) One concept to bind it all

Cluster ID: a UUID created by the first node that forms quorum (or by pairing with your cloud web-app). It‚Äôs persisted locally and advertised.
	‚Ä¢	Join Token: short-lived one-time secret for enrolling a new node; exchanged once during join; then the node rotates to long-lived credentials.
	‚Ä¢	Capability Announce: every node broadcasts NodeFacts (cpu, gpu, os/arch, disk, cameras, has_node, has_docker, net reachability).

Absolutely--let‚Äôs lock in an order-agnostic, self-configuring deployment that works the same no matter which of the five machines you install first. Below is the concrete plan that fits your existing services and code shape.

What we‚Äôre adding (in short)
	‚Ä¢	Cluster identity: CLUSTER_ID (UUID) + join token (short-lived).
	‚Ä¢	Zero-config discovery: LAN mDNS/UDP + QUIC overlay; no hardcoded upstream.
	‚Ä¢	Deterministic leader election: simple, stable rule until the supervisor is up.
	‚Ä¢	Plan synthesis: supervisor shapes per-node plans from announced capabilities.
	‚Ä¢	Safe defaults: CAS is stateless + dedup; quotas prevent the UI node from being crushed.

‚∏ª

1) Node identity & trust (tiny, durable)

Each node persists:
	‚Ä¢	NODE_ID (default = hostname)
	‚Ä¢	CLUSTER_ID (created by first node, then discovered or obtained via join)
	‚Ä¢	cluster public key (for JWT signing/verification) fetched once during join

First node (any of the 5) when no peers found:
	‚Ä¢	generates CLUSTER_ID
	‚Ä¢	generates signer keypair (or uses the one from your cloud onboarding)
	‚Ä¢	becomes bootstrap leader

Join flow (any later node):
	‚Ä¢	start with join token (short-lived JWT from the current leader or from your cloud web-app)
	‚Ä¢	exchange token ‚Üí receive cluster public key + CLUSTER_ID ‚Üí rotate to long-lived creds

Fits your existing bus + JWT middleware; stores minimal secrets; no vendor lock-in.

‚∏ª

2) LAN discovery (no upstream needed)

On start, discovery does:
	1.	mDNS/UDP probe: _thatdam._udp.local (or UDP 5353/another small port) ‚Üí "who‚Äôs leader?"
	2.	QUIC overlay ping to overlay-hub if any node is advertising it
	3.	Cloud rendezvous (optional): only if LAN probe fails and the user opted in

If no response after a short window ‚Üí self-init cluster (become bootstrap leader).
If responses exist ‚Üí join the one with the best deterministic score (see next).

‚∏ª

3) Deterministic leader election (tiny, robust)

We‚Äôll keep it simple and stable:
	‚Ä¢	Score = hash(CLUSTER_ID || NODE_ID || monotonic_boot_counter)
	‚Ä¢	The highest score is leader.
	‚Ä¢	Every node runs the election algorithm on the same inputs ‚Üí same result without chatter.
	‚Ä¢	Once the supervisor is up on the leader, it sends heartbeats; if missed, nodes re-run the rule and promote the next best.

This is "good enough" for a small ring; you can swap in Raft later without changing the outer shape.

‚∏ª

4) Capability announce ‚Üí plan synthesis

Each node publishes NodeFacts to the leader (and gossip cache):

cpu_cores, os, arch, ram_gb, disk_free_gb,
has_docker, has_node, cameras[], gpu?, net_iface[],
index_paths[], ui_available? (desktop), power_class (zero/pi/win/mac)

Supervisor returns a DesiredPlan (you already have this type) using simple rules:
	‚Ä¢	UI/Coordinator (first node with ui_available==true): api-gateway, web-app, supervisor, discovery, overlay-hub, media-api, catalog, light capture-daemon, blob-store.
	‚Ä¢	Storage/Headless worker (Pi 5 server): blob-store, deriver, media-api replica, capture-daemon.
	‚Ä¢	Compute/Indexer (Windows 11): indexer (INDEX_PATHS ‚Üí CAS), transcoder, optional capture-daemon, optional camera-proxy.
	‚Ä¢	Edge capture (Pi Zero): camera-proxy (LAN mode), auto proxy-viewer only if isolated.
	‚Ä¢	Intelligence (MacBook): indexer, stream-processor, optional capture-daemon.

Quotas (plan fields): limit concurrent derives/transcodes per node, reserve CPU for the UI node.

‚∏ª

5) Order-agnostic install (works in any order)

Common env (all nodes)

ROLE=auto
NODE_ID=<defaults to hostname>
CLUSTER_ID=<empty on first node; learned on join>
JWT_SECRET=<only for local dev; prod uses cluster keypair>
CAS_ROOT=/var/lib/thatdam/blobs
CAS_REPLICAS=1
INDEX_PATHS=<optional per device>

One-liners (examples)

Pi 5 (any OS)

sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y docker.io || true
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
export ROLE=auto NODE_ID=$(hostname) CAS_ROOT=/var/lib/thatdam/blobs
docker compose -f docker/compose/thatdam.yml up -d

Windows 11
	‚Ä¢	Install Docker Desktop (or run native binaries)
	‚Ä¢	Set env (PowerShell):

$env:ROLE="auto"
$env:NODE_ID="$env:COMPUTERNAME"
$env:INDEX_PATHS="D:\Footage;E:\Projects"
docker compose -f docker\compose\thatdam.yml up -d

MacBook

export ROLE=auto NODE_ID=$(hostname) INDEX_PATHS="$HOME/Movies"
docker compose -f docker/compose/thatdam.yml up -d

No upstream vars needed; discovery finds the ring or self-inits.

‚∏ª

6) capture-daemon vs camera-proxy (final cut)
	‚Ä¢	camera-proxy = edge live stream producer (Pi Zero / low-power).
	‚Ä¢	capture-daemon = aggregator/recorder to CAS + emits asset.ingested.
	‚Ä¢	Explorer shows all assets and cameras because catalog entries reference hashes, not paths.

Your earlier intuition is right:
	‚Ä¢	use capture-daemon when aggregating/recording (and for indexing existing files on compute boxes),
	‚Ä¢	use camera-proxy when you only need to provide a camera feed to the ring.

‚∏ª

7) "Manner of sharing" (fair and light)
	‚Ä¢	Heuristics: heavy jobs prefer nodes with os in {windows, darwin} and many cores.
	‚Ä¢	Soft quotas on each node (in DesiredPlan): max parallel derives/transcodes; reserve 30‚Äì50% CPU for local tasks.
	‚Ä¢	Contribution score: optional later--logs credits per node (easy to add without changing APIs).

‚∏ª

8) Public "recording house" (bring your own resources)
	‚Ä¢	The same nodes can optionally register with your cloud web-app (only for auth/licensing + rendezvous).
	‚Ä¢	After pairing, users are redirected to their local leader for the UI.
	‚Ä¢	If they enable public routes, the leader publishes a reverse-proxy token (no compute offload to your cloud).

‚∏ª

9) What to commit to the repo now
	‚Ä¢	/docs/deploy/PLAYBOOK.md (the above, condensed)
	‚Ä¢	docker/compose/thatdam.yml with per-node overrides (volumes/INDEX_PATHS)
	‚Ä¢	entrypoint-snippet.sh already chooses ROLE=auto ‚Üí keep
	‚Ä¢	discovery: add mDNS/UDP + overlay-hub QUIC probe
	‚Ä¢	supervisor: implement deterministic election rule + plan rules above
	‚Ä¢	catalog/CAS: already on the way; ensure hash-first ingest everywhere

‚∏ª

TL;DR

Install any of the five first. If alone, it bootstraps and becomes leader.
New nodes discover, join, and get a plan that fits their strengths.
No upstream hardcoding, no duplication, no UI slowdown--just peers sharing compute, storage bandwidth, and smarts.

Heck yes--we can make those five boxes behave like one peer-based ring without burying any single device. Here‚Äôs a tight deployment playbook that fits your current services and the "plan-driven" architecture we‚Äôve been shaping.

Deployment Playbook (MVP ring of 5)

Core rules (simple + robust)
	‚Ä¢	Peers, not subordinates. Every machine joins as a peer and announces capabilities; the first online becomes leader (via discovery + supervisor). If the leader goes away, another node takes over (same protocol).
	‚Ä¢	Role = auto. Use your shared entrypoint-snippet.sh. Each node sets ROLE=auto; discovery picks server if it is (or resolves to) the upstream, otherwise agent.
	‚Ä¢	Plans, not snowflakes. The supervisor returns a DesiredPlan per node (we already defined this). Plans decide which services run on that node, so you can safely add nodes and redistribute work.
	‚Ä¢	CAS = single truth. All media is stored by hash; adding nodes does not duplicate bytes. More nodes = more bandwidth and resilience, not more copies.

‚∏ª

Who runs what (per device profile)

Device	Joins as	Services (typical plan)	Why
Pi 5 (Pi OS Desktop)	Leader/Coordinator	api-gateway, supervisor, discovery, overlay-hub, media-api, catalog, web-app, capture-daemon (light), blob-store (FS/CAS)	First in ring, has GUI; hosts UI + control plane; light capture ok
Pi 5 (Ubuntu Server)	Peer Storage/Worker	blob-store (FS/CAS), capture-daemon (headless), deriver (thumbnails/HLS), media-api (replica), (optionally) camera-proxy	Adds storage + background work; HA for reads/derives
Windows 11 Desktop	Compute/Indexer	indexer (existing media ‚Üí CAS), transcoder, capture-daemon (if cameras), camera-proxy (optional)	Offload heavy transcode/analysis; indexes local media into CAS
Pi Zero W 2	Edge Capture	camera-proxy (+ tiny ring buffer), (standalone proxy-viewer only if off-LAN)	Lowest footprint; forwards streams to cluster
MacBook	Indexer/Stream Proc	indexer, stream-processor (live previews), capture-daemon (if cameras), (optional) web-app dev	High-burst CPU; great for on-demand indexing & smart previews

All five are peers. The leader is just the node currently answering supervisor/plan requests. Everyone else keeps working if the leader restarts--plans are cached and idempotent.

‚∏ª

Install order & reconciliation

1) Pi 5 (Pi OS Desktop) -- bootstrap the ring
	‚Ä¢	Env (or compose .env)

NODE_ID=pi5-desktop
ROLE=auto
SERVICE_PORT=8080
JWT_SECRET=change-me


	‚Ä¢	Result: Becomes leader (no upstream discovered), serves the web-app, starts media-api, catalog, CAS FS, and a light capture-daemon.
	‚Ä¢	Why light capture? Keeps UI snappy; heavy capture/transcode gets offloaded as more peers join.

2) Pi 5 (Ubuntu Server) -- add resilience + storage
	‚Ä¢	Env

NODE_ID=pi5-server
ROLE=auto
UPSTREAM_HOST=<pi5-desktop-hostname-or-ip>
UPSTREAM_PORT=8080


	‚Ä¢	Result: Joins as peer, not subordinate. Supervisor shapes a plan that adds: CAS FS replica, deriver, media-api replica, headless capture-daemon.
	‚Ä¢	Net effect: Reads/derives spread out; UI on Pi 5 Desktop doesn‚Äôt bog down.

3) Windows 11 Desktop -- compute + existing media indexing
	‚Ä¢	Install: Prefer Docker Desktop; if not, run native binaries.
	‚Ä¢	Env

NODE_ID=win11-editor
ROLE=auto
UPSTREAM_HOST=<pi5-desktop>
UPSTREAM_PORT=8080
INDEX_PATHS=D:\Footage;E:\Projects


	‚Ä¢	Result: Joins as peer; gets plan for indexer (walk INDEX_PATHS, CAS-ing files), transcoder worker, optional capture-daemon if cameras present.
	‚Ä¢	Protection: Supervisor quotas ensure transcodes run here, not on Pis. The Pi 5 Desktop stays responsive while the Windows node contributes heavy lifting.

4) Pi Zero W 2 -- edge camera proxy
	‚Ä¢	Env

NODE_ID=pizero-cam1
ROLE=auto
UPSTREAM_HOST=<pi5-desktop>
UPSTREAM_PORT=8080


	‚Ä¢	Result: Gets plan for camera-proxy only. If it can‚Äôt reach the ring (off-LAN), it auto-falls back to an embedded proxy-viewer--but in LAN mode it just forwards streams to the ring.

5) MacBook -- indexing & smart previews
	‚Ä¢	Env

NODE_ID=macbook
ROLE=auto
UPSTREAM_HOST=<pi5-desktop>
UPSTREAM_PORT=8080
INDEX_PATHS=/Users/me/Movies


	‚Ä¢	Result: Joins as peer; plan adds indexer and stream-processor that can derive fast previews from source hashes. (Optional web-app for local dev.)

	‚Ä¢	camera-proxy (edge): speaks to cameras and hands live streams to the ring (low CPU, tiny buffer). It‚Äôs the right fit for Pi Zero and small edge boxes.
	‚Ä¢	capture-daemon (aggregator): pulls from camera-proxy or files, segments/records to CAS, emits asset.ingested, and tracks health. It belongs on Pi 5s / Windows / Mac.

In practice: Pi Zero runs camera-proxy; Pi 5 server or Windows does the recording and derives--that‚Äôs how we avoid loading the UI node.

"Manner of sharing" (without complexity)

Keep it MVP-simple, upgrade later:
	‚Ä¢	Capability map: each node announces {cpu, os, arch, disk_free, has_node, has_docker, cameras} via discovery.
	‚Ä¢	Planner heuristics (supervisor):
	‚Ä¢	Heavy tasks ‚Üí nodes with windows|darwin & high CPU.
	‚Ä¢	Storage replicas ‚Üí nodes advertising large disks.
	‚Ä¢	UI stays on the node that has a desktop (first Pi 5).
	‚Ä¢	Soft quotas (per node):
	‚Ä¢	Reserve 30‚Äì50% CPU for local use.
	‚Ä¢	Limit concurrent derivations/transcodes per node.
	‚Ä¢	Fairness/credits: future, when you need multi-tenant fairness. Not required for MVP.

Minimal config you actually need

Across all nodes (compose or env):

# Discovery / Supervisor
ROLE=auto
NODE_ID=<unique>             # hostname is fine
SERVICE_PORT=8080

# Upstream hint (peers auto-detect; this just speeds first join)
UPSTREAM_HOST=<leader-hostname-or-ip>
UPSTREAM_PORT=8080

# Auth
JWT_SECRET=change-me

# CAS
CAS_ROOT=/var/lib/thatdam/blobs          # local FS
CAS_REPLICAS=1                           # MVP: no extra copy; set 2+ when ready

# Indexer (on Windows/Mac nodes)
INDEX_PATHS=/path1;/path2

Your entrypoint-snippet.sh already sets ROLE using UPSTREAM_* + host IP checks--this plugs right in.

What happens on join (reconciliation)
	1.	Node boots ‚Üí discovery announces ‚Üí supervisor returns DesiredPlan.
	2.	Plan applier starts services using the best adapter available: runtime_exec (native), runtime_docker (if Docker), or runtime_ns (when you wire it).
	3.	CAS stays stateless. New media from Windows/Mac is hashed and de-duplicated on ingest; no extra copies on the Pis.
	4.	Work shifts automatically. If a node with better capabilities arrives, the supervisor updates plans so heavy tasks route there.

‚∏ª

Frontend experience (Explorer + Monitor)
	‚Ä¢	Explorer sees all assets (no matter where they originated) because catalog keys point to hashes, not paths.
	‚Ä¢	Monitor lists all cameras (from any camera-proxy) and lets you start capture on a chosen worker node (Pi 5 server or Windows/Mac).
	‚Ä¢	Previews are served from the nearest node with the derived asset; if missing, a deriver job is queued on the best worker.

Quick start snippets (per class)

Pi family (Pi OS/Ubuntu)

# prerequisites
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y docker.io || true
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER

# env (adjust HOST/IP)
export NODE_ID=pi5-desktop
export ROLE=auto
export UPSTREAM_HOST=   # leave empty on first node
export UPSTREAM_PORT=8080
export JWT_SECRET=change-me
export CAS_ROOT=/var/lib/thatdam/blobs

# run (compose or systemd; use your repo‚Äôs compose file)
docker compose -f docker/compose/docker-compose.yml up -d

Windows 11
	‚Ä¢	Install Docker Desktop or run binaries.
	‚Ä¢	Set INDEX_PATHS to your footage drives.
	‚Ä¢	Use the same compose with Windows volume mappings.

MacBook
	‚Ä¢	brew install docker (or Docker Desktop).
	‚Ä¢	Set INDEX_PATHS, same flow.

‚∏ª

Why this works with your repo today
	‚Ä¢	Uses the plan types + client you already added.
	‚Ä¢	Reuses your bootstrap runtimes (exec/docker) to choose per node automatically.
	‚Ä¢	Leans on CAS to avoid duplication and make the blob store stateless + preview-able.
	‚Ä¢	Keeps frontend centralized (on the first Pi 5) but it‚Äôs just another app in the plan--easy to move later.

TL;DR answers to your big questions
	‚Ä¢	Peer vs subordinate? Peer. New nodes join as equals; the first Pi 5 just happens to lead.
	‚Ä¢	capture-daemon vs camera-proxy?
	‚Ä¢	camera-proxy: edge/lite stream source.
	‚Ä¢	capture-daemon: records/segments to CAS + emits events.
	‚Ä¢	Edge ‚Üí Proxy, Worker ‚Üí Capture.
	‚Ä¢	Will Windows indexing bog down the Pi UI? No. The plan sends indexing/transcoding to Windows; Pi‚Äôs quotas keep its UI responsive.
	‚Ä¢	Does this scale across the 5 devices you listed? Yes. Same binaries, same env shape, plan decides the rest.
