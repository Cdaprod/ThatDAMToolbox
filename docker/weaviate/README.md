Absolutely, David!
Below is a Weaviate schema tailored for a full-stack DAM system that tracks both your videos (digital assets) and the hardware/software capture events/devices. This design will support:
	•	Asset search, enrichment, and preview in your app.
	•	Full audit trail: which device, when, where, and how a file was captured.
	•	Fast linking to records, events, and optionally, workflow metadata.

You can evolve this—but it’s production-ready and covers 95% of what’s typical for AI-powered DAM and IoT-capture scenarios.

Weaviate Schema for Digital Asset Management + Video Capture

Below, you get two key Classes:
	•	VideoAsset: represents each video (or image, or audio) asset.
	•	CaptureDevice: represents a capture daemon instance, camera, sensor, etc.
	•	CaptureEvent: (optional but powerful) links a device, time, and asset.

How to Use
	•	VideoAsset gets an object for every unique file or asset.
	•	CaptureDevice gets one for each Pi, camera, daemon, or even virtual device.
	•	CaptureEvent is created each time a new asset is captured, and links to both the asset and the device (for full audit trail).

Deploy Schema

You can create this schema with a script using the Weaviate Python client or via a POST to http://localhost:8083/v1/schema.

Example (Python, run in your dev container):

import weaviate
import json

client = weaviate.Client("http://localhost:8083")

with open("scripts/weaviate/schema.json") as f:
    schema = json.load(f)

for class_obj in schema["classes"]:
    try:
        client.schema.create_class(class_obj)
        print(f"Created class: {class_obj['class']}")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error creating class {class_obj['class']}: {e}")


⸻

What to Do Next
	•	Add new properties (like preview URLs, checksums, workflow status) as needed.
	•	Connect this schema into your capture-daemon and video-api: create events/assets on ingest, link with device IDs.
	•	You can use Weaviate’s hybrid search, nearText, or filters to power your dashboard, asset explorer, or timeline.

⸻

Schema Evolution Tips
	•	Add new fields anytime (Weaviate is forgiving; old data is untouched).
	•	You can also use modules like text2vec-openai for semantic search with a single config change.

Let me know if you want a TypeScript client example, schema-creation as a Makefile task, or tight integration with your asset ingest pipeline!
This will power a real, production DAM with full provenance and search.
